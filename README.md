Challenge 4: Code Quiz.

When I click the start button.
The quiz starts and the user is given a question to answer, as well as a displayed timer.

When I answer a question.
The user is prompted with a correct or incorrect prompt, and then moves onto the next question.

When I answer a question incorrectly. 
Time is taken away from the user, so less time is available for the user to take the quiz.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
Then the game ends and asks for the users initials.

When the game is over.
The user should be able to save and record their scores, however is doesn't work properly. ( I am aware it is broken but wanted to turn it in. )
